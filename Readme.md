# Utilities to work with Kiota

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/andreaTP/kiota-utils.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#andreaTP/kiota-utils)

This is still highly experimental, expects changes any time.

## TODO

- find a good way to set a Kiota version (java-template?)
- combine Kiota libraries versions with RH provided additional libs (e.g. `kiota-rh-auth`)?
- produce a BOM with aggregated Kiota libraries and RH libs
